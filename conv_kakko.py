From The Designers
We've found that Attack Speed & Attack Effect builds only need 3 key pieces of equipment to get their Attack Speed, Damage, and Lifesteal bonuses, while Attack Speed & Crit. builds need 4. So we decided to add the effects of [Scarlet Phantom] to [Haas' Claws], meaning that you can now make an Attack Speed & Crit. build with the 3 following pieces: [Haas' Claws] + [Windtalker] + [Berserker's Fury]. We're also replacing [Scarlet Phantom] with the new CD reduction & crit. equipment - [Great Dragon Spear]. This is to provide more equipment options for heroes who rely on crit, but don't need Attack Speed.

What's more, we've adjusted the EXP requirements for levelling up in the early game and the EXP gained from Creeps, and made the Turtles more rewarding. This will hopefully lead to fiercer contention over the first Turtle.

Naturally, we're also rolling out balance changes to many of our heroes. We hope you'll enjoy the new version!

I. Hero Adjustments
The following uses (↑) (↓) (~) to indicate Buff, Nerf, and Adjustment.

[Natalia] (↑)

Escaping the enemy's vision is a unique part of Natalia's gameplay. However, the rules surrounding how this works were often difficult to understand, and enemies had a hard time countering it. With this round of adjustments, we're making it easier for Natalia to enter and maintain her Camouflage state for ganking. We're also increasing visibility of this for the enemy, in the hopes that both sides will have a more enjoyable experience.

Meanwhile, we're adjusting Natalia's damage calculations to make things easier to understand and more effective.

[Passive] (↓)

Removed Effect: Natalia conceals herself for 5s after remaining in the bush for 2s. She marks an enemy upon drawing close, increasing damage dealt from behind.

New Effect: Natalia camouflages herself after remaining in the bush for 1s. Taking damage will immediately end the Camouflage state. While she no longer marks enemies, she retains her Enhanced Basic Attacks for 1s after leaving the Camouflage state.

Initial Crit Damage: 140% >> 150%

Enhanced Basic Attack's Damage: 200 + 130% Physical Attack >> 200 + 110% Physical Attack

Fixed an issue where her Enhanced Basic Attacks wouldn't deal enough damage to Creeps or Turrets.

[Skill 1] (↑)

Damage: 185-260 + 40% Physical Attack >> 250-350 + 50% Physical Attack

[Skill 2] (~)

Slow Effect: 25%-50% >> 25%-75%

Removed the Attack Speed boost.

Fixed an issue where the actual area of effect didn't match the area shown.

[Ultimate] (↑)

Removed the Physical Attack increased for 3s upon casting.

New Effect: Crit Chance increases by 15-45% when the Ultimate is upgraded.

[Other]

Optimized Natalia's Battle Setup. She now requires more Crit Chance and CD Reduction equipment.

[Aulus] (↑)

We're trying to increase Aulus's laning sustainability in the early game and make it easier for him to join teamfights in the late game.

[Skill 1] (↑)

Cooldown: 10s at all levels >> 16-14s (scales with level)

Duration: 3s >> 5s

New Frontal Damage Reduction Effect: Every 10 Extra Physical Attack increases Damage Reduction by 1%, up to 60%

[Skill 2] (↑)

Cooldown: 10-5s (scales with level) >> 5s at all levels

Attack Speed Boost: 200% at all levels >> 100%-200% (scales with level)

HP Regen: 25-100 + 35% Extra Physical Attack >> 50-100

[Ultimate] (↑)

Hammer Craft: 15% Lifesteal >> 10% Crit Chance

First Damage Bonus: 140% Extra Physical Attack >> 100% Extra Physical Attack

Continuous Damage Bonus: 60% Extra Physical Attack >> 40% Extra Physical Attack

[Other]

Optimized Aulus' Battle Setup. Now he needs Crit Chance and CD Reduction equipment more.

[Alucard] (↑)

We're optimizing Alucard's damage ratios and making him perform better without the Ultimate.

[Passive] (↑)

Deals extra damage when hitting enemies with skills >> Deals extra damage when hitting enemy heroes with skills. (Hitting Minions at the same time doesn't reduce his damage to heroes.)

Skill Damage Ratio Upon Hitting an Enemy Hero: 1.5x >> 1.3x

Enhanced Basic Attack's Damage Ratio: 1.2x >> 1.4x

[Ultimate] (↑)

New Effect: Gains 5%-15% Hybrid Lifesteal after unlocking the Ultimate.

Extra Hybrid Lifesteal Upon Casting the Ultimate: 28%-40% >> 15%-25%

[Other]

Optimized Alucard's Battle Setup. He now requires more Crit Chance and CD Reduction equipment.

[Yu Zhong] (↑)

We want to make Yu Zhong's passive simpler while also somewhat buffing his laning potential.

[Passive] (~)

Optimized Sha Residue's flying path as it returns to Yu Zhong after it erupts and slightly raised its flight speed (HP Regen speed is now faster).

New Effect: Yu Zhong gains 30% extra Movement Speed when Sha Residue erupts.

Removed Effect: Removed Sha Essence.

[Skill 1] (↑)

Cooldown: 7-5.5s >> 6-4.5s

Spell Vamp Ratio to Minions: 50% >> 100%

[Skill 2] (↑)

Slightly increased the range of his Enhanced Basic Attacks.

[Ultimate] (↓)

He no longer deals damage to nearby enemies when he enters Dragonoid form.

[Ixia] (↑)

Ixia was strong in mid-to-late-game teamfights, but it took too long for her to get a proper build running. That's why we're buffing her early game potential a bit.

[Attributes] (↓)

Attack Speed Growth: 3.45% >> 2%

[Skill 1] (↑)

Damage: 125-225 + 60% Total Physical Attack >> 175-300 + 80% Total Physical Attack

[Ultimate] (↑)

New Effect: Increases Attack Speed by 50%.

[Irithel] (↑)

Irithel was a bit weak without her Ultimate, so we reduced the cooldown time of her Ultimate while also reducing the duration of her Ultimate to balance things out.

[Ultimate] (↑)

Cooldown: 45-39s >> 30-24s

Duration: 15s >> 10s

[Odette] (↑)

Based on player feedback and performance data from the Official Server, we feel that the adjustments made in the previous patch did not meet our expectations. So we have decided to bring back the dash of her Ultimate.

[Ultimate] (↑)

New Effect: Use again while her Ultimate is active to dash in the target direction.

[Lylia] (↑)

Since Lylia's Ultimate can restore both her HP and Shadow Energy charges, it's hard to decide when to cast it. The question would be whether it makes sense to use her Ultimate to restore Energy when she is at full HP, or vice versa. That's why we decided to remove the Shadow Energy charge restoration effect and buff Gloom and Shadow Energy to make the gameplay simpler.

[Passive] (↑)

Gloom Flying Speed: 12 >> 16

[Skill 2] (↑)

Energy Charging Time: 9-9s >> 9.8-5s

[Ultimate] (↓)

Effect Removed: Restores all Shadow Energy charges.

[Zilong] (↑)

We're increasing Zilong's laning ability slightly in the early game.

[Passive] (↑)

Damage: 50% Total Physical Attack >> 30 + 40% Total Physical Attack

HP Regen: 50% Total Physical Attack (1 Time) >> 30 +20% Total Physical Attack (3 Times)

[Skill 2] (↑)

Extended Triggering Time: The skill cooldown now also resets if a Minion dies within 0.5s after Zilong dealing damage to them.

[Other]

Optimized Zilong's Battle Setup.

[Leomord] (↑)

Optimized Leomord's equipment options.

[Passive] (~)

New Effect: Every 1% of Leomord's Crit Chance will be converted into 1 Physical Attack.

[Ultimate] (↑)

Cooldown: 45-35s >> 40-30s

[Other]

Optimized Leomord's Battle Setup.

[Ruby] (↑)

We're hoping to increase Ruby's damage potential while wearing attack equipment, while also increasing Skill 1's cast frequency.

[Skill 1] (↑)

Base Damage: 90-215 >> 90 at all levels

Total Physical Attack Bonus: 70%-95% >> 70-130%

Cooldown: 4s at all levels >> 4-3s (scales with level)

[Ling] (↓)

With the Talent and equipment changes, it's easier for Ling to get extra Crit Chance. Our goal is for Ling to use or work toward stacking Crit Chance rather than focusing on Attack Speed.

[Attributes] (↓)

Attack Speed Ratio: 100% >> 80%

[Passive] (↓)

Crit Chance Multiplier: 2x >> 1.5x

[Yve] (↓)

Yve can not only speed up but also slow enemies frequently, so we're cutting down her slow ability while keeping her speed-ups.

[Skill 2] (↓)

Slow Effect: 25%-75% >> 15%-40%

[Ultimate] (↓)

Slow Effect from Swipe: 75% >> 40%

Cooldown: 58-50s >> 60s

[Alpha] (↓)

After the Emblem changes, Alpha is too powerful in the early game, so we're toning down his damage and HP Regen.

[Passive] (↓)

Extra Physical Attack Bonus: 100% >> 80%

[Skill 2] (↓)

Base Damage: 250-500 >> 180-500

HP Regen: 100-200 >> 40-200

[Freya] (↓)

It was too easy for Freya to keep spamming her Skil 2, which allowed her to nullify all Attack Speed Reduction effects, leaving enemies no way to counter her. And that was something we wanted to change.

[Skill 2] (↓)

Cooldown: 9-6s >> 10-8s

Time to cast the skill again: 5s >> 3.5s

Max Attack Speed >> +200% Attack Speed

[Arlott] (↓)

It's quite terrible to be on the receiving end of Arlott's Ultimate, so we've decided to give his enemy more time to react by slightly increasing the cooldown time of his Ultimate.

[Ultimate] (↓)

Cooldown: 20-16s >> 30-24s

Slightly increased the skill's foreswing time and added a warning effect.

[Xavier] (↑)

We've improved Xavier's early-game performance and laning power slightly.

[Skill 1] (↑)

Base Damage: 350-600 >> 425-625

[Nana] (~)

Nana's early-game damage is too low, so we're adjusting her growth curve to make it easier to clear lanes and give her more things to do in the early and mid game. Though, we're also slightly reducing her damage in the late game.

[Skill 1] (↑)

Base Damage: 245-370 >> 320-440

Magic Power Bonus: 120%>> 100%

[Ultimate] (↓)

Base Damage: 400-680 >> 440-660

Magic Power Bonus: 180% >> 160%

[Vexana] (~)

Because of the long cooldown, Vexana can't use her skills and passive to quickly clear lanes in the early game, so we're adjusting the numbers of Deathly Grasp. To balance things out, we're tuning down the damage she gets from her Passive in the early game.

[Passive] (↓)

Base Damage: 220-500 >> 108-500

[Skill 2] (↑)

Base Damage: 450-750 >> 580-850

Magic Power Bonus: 200% >> 180%

[Aldous] (~)

To emphasize Aldous' role as Exp Laner, we adjusted his Skill 1 to allow him to gain more Soul Steal stacks from Siege Minions, but lowered the damage increase from each Soul Steal stack to balance things out.

[Skill 1] (~)

Stacks Gained from Siege Minion Kills: 4 >> 10

Stacks Gained from Nearby Siege Minion Deaths: 2 >> 5

Skill 1 Damage Increase Per Stack: 6 >> 5

[Alice] (~)

We adjusted Alice's Passive against Siege Minions and changed the skill effects accordingly to balance things out.

[Passive] (~)

Siege Minions now drop 2 blood orbs when killed.

Max HP Increase Per Orb: 10 >> 8

Max Mana Increase Per Orb: 20 >> 15

Number of Orbs Required for Extra Movement Speed: 50 >> 60

[Faramis] (~)

We've slightly increased the damage of his Skill 2 based on each hero hit, but lowered the max number of bounces. (The damage on 3 hero hits remains the same.)

[Skill 2]

Nether Energy Bounces on Hero Hits: 3 >> 2

Magic Power Bonus: 72% >> 86%

lI. Battlefield Adjustments
[EXP Adjustments]
We optimized the EXP requirements for levelling up in the early game to give more possibilities to the fight over the first Turtle. Meanwhile, we made the Turtles more rewarding.

1- Increased EXP required for Lv. 2-4 and reduced that for Lv. 4-6, but the total EXP required between Lv. 2-6 remains the same.

2- To balance out the EXP adjustments, we've buffed the base EXP gained from Horned Lizards, Fire Beetles and Lava Golems to make Junglers reach level 4 sooner. However, reaching level 4 will still take longer than it did before the changes.

3- Increased the team EXP gained from Turtle kills by 12.5%.

[Turrets]
Everyone is equal in front of the Turrets!

Changed damage dealt to Turrets from 100% Physical Attack + 60% Magic Power to 100% Physical Attack + 100% Magic Power. Mages can push as efficiently now.

Damage Reflection: 20% Damage Before Reduction >> 30% Damage Before Reduction

[Steel Legplates] (↓)

This piece of equipment works for more or less everyone, so we slightly increased its price.

Basic Common Emblem (↓): Hybrid Regen 15 >> 12

[Talents]

Some data may differ from your personal experience, but we will not be adjusting the scores based on player feedback.
